= Istio Add-on

This add-on deploys the https://Istio.io/[Istio] **servicemesh** on to Minishift-provisioned OpenShift cluster.

NOTE: The add-on was tested with Istio release v1.0.1

== Minishift profile setup

The standard Istio setup deploys around four to five applications like *istio-ingress*, *istio-egress*, *istio-pilot*, *grafana*, *prometheus* and their related resources
such as https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/[configmaps], https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[secrets]
and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resource Definitions].

Considering this, it is ideal to setup a Minishift profile with the following configuration:

[code,sh]
----
$ minishift profile set servicemesh <1>
$ minishift config set memory 8GB <2>
$ minishift config set cpus 3 <3>
$ minishift addon enable dynamic-admission-controllers <4>
$ minishift addon enable istio
$ minishift start servicemesh<5>
----

<1> Create a new Minishift profile named **servicemesh**
<2> Use 8GB of memory for Istio and apps that you might deploy later
<3> 3 CPUs results in a maximum of 30 pods, since Istio deploys approximately 9 pods at minimum
<4> Enable the Minishift `dynamic-admission-controllers` add-on for enabling auto injection of side-car container.
<5> Since we have set the profile to be **servicemesh**, this command starts Minishift with profile **servicemesh**
